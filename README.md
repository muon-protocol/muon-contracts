# V3 Updates

- reqId calculates deterministically and must be signed and verified on the chain.

- SchnorrSECP256K1 is on MuonV03 and does not need a contract call anymore. It reduced gas.

- The apps can verify both TSS and Gateway signatures. It letâ€™s the apps run their own gateway and accept the requests that are initiated by their own gateway.

- APP_ID, reqId must be the first 2 fields in the signature.
